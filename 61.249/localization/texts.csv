Once you have unlocked all rewards of a certain type, for example Rare Brawlers, the probability to get all other rewards will increase. Luck: In order to make the Brawl Box opening experience fairer, there is a luck system affecting the probability of Legendary Brawlers. With each draw that doesn't give you a new Brawler, your luck value is increased. Each time you get a new Brawler, your luck value decreases based on the rarity of the Brawler you got. When luck is high enough, you have a higher chance to get a Legendary Brawler, chance will not go higher than <MAX_LEGENDARY>%.
